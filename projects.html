  <h1>Hi! I'm Tessa!</h1>
  <p>This site contains a portfolio of some of my projects that I've done outside of classes. If you'd like to see some of my smaller projects, visit <a href="https://github.com/miroreo">my github</a>, where I keep most of my projects.</p>

    <h2>cta-bot</h2>
    <a href="https://github.com/miroreo/cta-discord-rust">Project GitHub Repository</a>
    <p>cta-bot is a Discord chat-bot that I've developed, which uses the CTA's TrainTracker API to provide train information to users.</p>
    <p>The chat-bot can also analyze various outputs from the CTA's TrainTracker API to determine if there are any unplanned service interruptions or reroutes.</p>
    <p>I have been using this project to learn more about API data and resilient program design. Recently, I've been using this project as a way to learn the Rust programming language, you can view my progress on this iteration on my project GitHub</p>

    <h2>Chicago Streets Guessing Game</h2>
    <a href="https://github.com/miroreo/chicago-street-sveltekit">Project GitHub Repository</a>
    <p>This is a web game written in Svelte, where the objective is to name as many streets as you can in the City of Chicago. This was built upon City of Chicago open data, specifically, the Street Center Lines dataset from the Chicago Data Portal. One of the main things that I gained from this project was a better understanding of geospacial processing and map rendering.</p>
    <p>There are definitely some performance issues in the way this app was designed, and I hope to improve on these soon.</p>

    <h2>Bamboo Ninja</h2>
    <a href="https://miroreo.github.io/KaboomJam">Play the game</a>
    <a href="https://github.com/miroreo/KaboomJam">Project GitHub Repository</a>
    <p>This is a game that I created with a friend for the 2021 Replit Kaboom Game Jam. It's written in JavaScript and the (now deprecated) Kaboom game engine. My main role in the project was producing the art assets, and designing various aspects of the game.</p>
    <p>The project won first place in the Game Jam. Since 2021, the Kaboom game engine has become non-functional, and there are now some portions of the game that no longer work (such as the sweeping animation).</p>

    <h2>TechNews Website</h2>
    <a href="https://technews.iit.edu">Visit the website</a>
    <p>This is the website that I've configured and maintained for Illinois Tech's TechNews newspaper. In my position as TechNews' webmaster, I've been responsible for setting up this site and making sure that all of our users are properly trained on how to use it. This site is primarily used by our writers and editorial staff, as it is the primary place where our contributors submit content.</p>
    <p>This project involved configuring a Debian (linux) server with Caddy, WordPress, and various WordPress plugins. Even though I've done many web-related projects, this was my first project that would have immediate and larger viewership, so hardening it against potential attacks was an important aspect of this project.</p>
