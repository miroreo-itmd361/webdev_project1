  <h1>Trains are cool</h1>
  <p>Have you ever looked up above MTCC as the Green Line whooshes by? Isn't it awesome how we live in a city as great as Chicago and have easy access to cheap, reliable public transportation?</p>
  <p>Few Americans live in walking distance of public transit, we should appreciate it every time we use it.</p>
  <p>If you've ever ridden the Green Line to IIT, this sound is likely familiar to you!</p>

  <p>One of my favorite parts of living in the city is the ability to be a night owl without a car. If you want to go on an adventure, time of day doesn't have to matter. This photo is one I took at Lake Red Line station a few weeks ago and it's a very gentle calm that you get at 3am.</p>
